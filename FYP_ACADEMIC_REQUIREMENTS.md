END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Applied Triggers:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER users_updated_at_trigger
BEFORE UPDATE ON public.users
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

CHECK (difficulty >= 1 AND difficulty <= 5)  -- Ensures valid difficulty
```

**Unique Constraints:**
```sql
UNIQUE(user_id, question_id)  -- Prevents duplicate attempts
UNIQUE(email)                  -- Prevents duplicate accounts
```

### 3.5 Database Queries & Operations

#### **A. Complex Analytics Queries**

**User Performance Statistics:**
```sql
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.full_name,
    u.total_score,
    COUNT(up.id) as total_questions_answered,
    SUM(CASE WHEN up.is_correct THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as correct_answers,
    ROUND(
        (SUM(CASE WHEN up.is_correct THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::FLOAT / 
         COUNT(up.id) * 100), 2
    ) as accuracy_percentage
FROM public.users u
LEFT JOIN public.user_progress up ON u.id = up.user_id
WHERE u.id = $1
GROUP BY u.id, u.full_name, u.total_score;
```

**Module Progress Tracking:**
```sql
SELECT 
    q.module_type,
    q.difficulty,
    COUNT(DISTINCT q.id) as total_questions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT up.question_id) as answered_questions,
    ROUND(
        (COUNT(DISTINCT up.question_id)::FLOAT / 
         COUNT(DISTINCT q.id) * 100), 2
    ) as completion_percentage
FROM public.questions q
LEFT JOIN public.user_progress up ON q.id = up.question_id AND up.user_id = $1
WHERE q.module_type = $2
GROUP BY q.module_type, q.difficulty
ORDER BY q.difficulty;
```

**Leaderboard Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.full_name,
    u.avatar_url,
    u.total_score,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY u.total_score DESC) as rank
FROM public.users u
WHERE u.role = 'user'
ORDER BY u.total_score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### **B. Real-time Subscriptions**

**Using Supabase Realtime:**
```dart
// Subscribe to user progress updates
final subscription = supabase
    .from('user_progress')
    .stream(primaryKey: ['id'])
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .listen((List<Map<String, dynamic>> data) {
      // Update UI with new progress
    });
